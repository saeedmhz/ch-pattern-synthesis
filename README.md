# Enhancing Mechanical Metamodels With A Generative Model-Based Augmented Training Dataset
This repository contains code + data to regenerate the results of the metamodeling section presented in  
[**Link to the paper**]()  

In this work, we train a _feed-forward convolutional neural network_ on a dataset of _heterogeneous hyperelastic materials_ going through _equibiaxial extension_ to predict the stored strain energy in unseen materials. Material heterogeneity is based on **Cahn-Hilliard** patterns and all results are obtained through Finite Element Simulations using [**FEniCS**](https://fenicsproject.org/).

We also show the effect of augmenting the training set by synthetic patterns generated by a [**StyleGAN2-ADA**](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada) network trained on real patterns.

## This repository contains the following
* Datasets ([`data.zip`](data.zip)): Compressed versions of the datasets used in this work for metamodel training and testing
* Jupyter Notebook ([`metamodel.ipynb`](metamodel.ipynb)): Tensorflow implementation of our metamodel in addition to a more detailed explanation on metamodel and generative model training and testing
